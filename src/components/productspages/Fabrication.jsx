                  The fabrication process typically begins with cutting the sheet metal to the required size and shape using tools such as shears, laser cutters, or waterjet machines. Once cut, the metal sheets may undergo various forming processes, including bending, rolling, and stamping, to achieve the desired shape and dimensions. Welding and joining techniques are then employed to assemble the individual parts into the final product.
